# Delivery-Management-database
The Delivery Management Database is a relational database system designed to manage and track all aspects of the delivery process. It consists of multiple interlinked tables connected through primary and foreign keys. The database includes a Customer table that stores essential customer details such as name, location, and contact number. The Orders table captures order-specific information, including order price, the customer who placed the order, delivery status, and payment status. It also records the payment method used for each transaction. This structure ensures efficient data retrieval, integrity, and comprehensive tracking of deliveries and payments.
